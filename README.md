Fake Job Detection
This project aims to build a machine learning model that detects fake job postings based on various features. The dataset contains job listings, and the goal is to predict whether a job posting is real or fake based on the provided features.

Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes the following dependencies:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

tensorflow (if using deep learning models)

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains job listings with features like:

Job title

Company

Location

Job description

Salary (if provided)

Other metadata

You can find the dataset in the data/ directory or provide your own dataset for testing.

Preprocessing
Before training the model, the dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps:

Handling Missing Data: Missing values in columns are handled using imputation techniques.

Feature Encoding: Categorical variables such as job titles and company names are encoded into numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Text Processing: Job descriptions are cleaned and tokenized to prepare them for use in machine learning models. Techniques such as stopword removal and stemming can be applied.

Feature Scaling: Numerical features are scaled to ensure they are on a similar range for the model training.

Model Training
The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms to classify job postings as fake or real. The main steps are:

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Choice: Different machine learning algorithms are experimented with (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, or even Neural Networks).

Model Training: The chosen model is trained on the training set, and hyperparameters are tuned for optimal performance.

Example code for training a Random Forest Classifier:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Train the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Evaluation
The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

These metrics help to assess how well the model is identifying fake job postings compared to real ones.

Example of model evaluation:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
Usage
You can run the notebook on Google Colab to get started with the fake job detection model. After loading the dataset and preprocessing it, you can train the model and evaluate its performance.

To test the model with new data:

Preprocess the new job listing the same way as the training data.

Use the trained model to predict whether the job listing is real or fake:

python
Copy
Edit
new_job = ['Software Engineer', 'Tech Company', 'San Francisco', 'Build applications...']
processed_job = preprocess(new_job)  # Apply the same preprocessing as during training

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(processed_job)
if prediction == 1:
    print("The job posting is real.")
else:
    print("The job posting is fake.")
